# Enhancing-Electrical-Network-Vulnerability-Assessment-with-Machine-Learning
Overview
Welcome to the Grid Hub repository! This repository houses the code, datasets, and details for our project focusing on electricity grids. The project leverages data from both the SciGRID project and GridKit, employing spatial and topological analyses to model electric power systems.

Code
The code included in this repository implements a methodology for creating models of electricity grids. It encompasses scripts designed for the PostgreSQL database, utilizing PostGIS spatial extensions for efficient handling of geographical data. The code facilitates heuristic analysis to enhance route-based studies in the context of the SciGRID project.

Dataset
Our project relies on two datasets: one from the SciGRID project and another from GridKit. The SciGRID dataset focuses on automated grid model creation, serving research and related applications. GridKit utilizes spatial and topological analysis to transform OpenStreetMap map objects into a network model of the electric power system. These datasets form the foundation for our comprehensive analysis.

Project Details
Our project aims to advance the understanding of electricity grids through the integration of heuristic analysis and route-based studies. By combining the strengths of the SciGRID and GridKit datasets, we explore innovative approaches to model and analyze electric power systems.

Feel free to explore the code, datasets, and additional documentation provided in this repository. For any inquiries or collaboration opportunities, please reach out to our project team. Thank you for your interest in Grid Hub!
